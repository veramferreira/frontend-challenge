# Viewport Grid

## Task

Using the provided project template (based off create-react-app), create single page application that contains a uniform Grid of Viewports, with a fixed Sidebar. The Sidebar shall contain the inputs "Rows" and "Columns" both of which must be in the range of 1-10, and a button to collapse and expand the Sidebar. The Grid must show the defined number of "Rows" and "Columns", with a Viewport at each position. The Grid must fill remaining space and fit all Viewports equally, with a small gutter between them, and efficiently adapt to browser resizes and Sidebar collapsing/expanding. Each Viewport must have a thin border. Viewports must also be aware of their size at all times and be printed at its center.
The example colours are just for reference and styling should be adjusted for a clean modern UX.
